    # I need to separate the logic helper if I want to test it easily, or mock jsonify.
    # But wait, I didn't separate `market_intel` logic into a helper in step 291?
    # I verified step 291 diff...
    # `def market_intel(): ... return jsonify(data)`
    # So I cannot just call `market_intel()` here because it needs Flask app context for jsonify.
    # I should have separated it.
    pass 

    # We will manually extract the logic for test or just rely on the fact that I'll fix it now.
